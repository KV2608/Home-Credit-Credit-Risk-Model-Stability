- Over 1 million loan application records

## Models Used
- LightGBM
- CatBoost
- XGBoost
- Ensemble learning

## Key Work
- Feature engineering and preprocessing
- Model training and hyperparameter tuning
- Stability and robustness analysis
- Ensemble modeling for improved performance

## Results
- Improved predictive performance by 18%
- Achieved Top 5% ranking (AUC 0.576) among 2,800+ teams in a global Kaggle competition

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
